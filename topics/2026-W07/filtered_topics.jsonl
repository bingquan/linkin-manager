My answer: Regulate AI use, not the underlying models.</span></p><h2>Why model-centric regulation fails</h2><p><span><span>Proposals to license \u201cfrontier\u201d training runs, restrict open weights, or require permission before publishing models, such as California\u2019s </span></span><a href=\"https://legiscan.com/CA/text/SB53/id/3270002\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act, </span></span></a><span><span>promise </span><span>control</span> but deliver theater. Model weights and code are digital artifacts; once released, by a lab, a leak, or a foreign competitor, they replicate at near-zero cost. You </span><span>can\u2019t</span> unpublish weights, geofence research, or prevent distillation into smaller models. Trying to bottle up artifacts yields two bad outcomes: Compliant firms drown in paperwork, while reckless <span>actors</span> route around rules offshore, underground, or both.</p><p><span>In the United States, model-publication licensing also likely collides with speech law. Federal courts have treated software source code as protected expression, so any system that prevents the publication of AI models would be vulnerable to legal challenges. </span></p><p><span><span>\u201cDo nothing\u201d is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-regulation-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">not an option</a> either. Without guardrails, we will keep seeing </span></span><a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/increasing_threats_of_deepfake_identities_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>deepfake scams</span></span></a><span><span>, automated fraud, and mass-persuasion campaigns until a headline catastrophe triggers a blunt response </span><span>optimized</span> for optics, not outcomes.</span></p><h2>A practical alternative: Regulate use, proportionate to risk</h2><p><span><span>A use-based regime classifies deployments by risk and scales obligations accordingly. Here is a workable template focused on keeping enforcement where systems </span><span>actually touch</span> people:</span></p><ol start=\"1\"><li><span><strong>Baseline: General-purpose consumer interaction</strong></span><span> (open-ended chat, creative writing, learning </span><span>assistance</span><span>, casual productivity). </span> <br /><span>Regulatory adherence: clear AI disclosure at point of interaction, published acceptable-use policies, technical guardrails preventing escalation into higher-risk tiers, and a mechanism for users to flag problematic outputs.</span> </li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><span><strong><span>Low-risk </span><span>assistance</span></strong></span><span> (drafting, summarization</span><span>, basic</span> productivity). <br /><span>Regulatory adherence</span><em><span><em>:</em></span></em> simple disclosure, baseline data hygiene. </li></ol><ol start=\"3\"><li><span><strong>Moderate-risk decision support affecting individuals</strong></span> (hiring triage, benefits screening, loan prequalification). <br /><span>Regulatory adherence</span><em><span><em>:</em></span></em> documented risk assessment, meaningful human oversight, and an \u201cAI bill of materials\u201d consisting of at least the model lineage, key evaluations, and mitigations. </li></ol><ol start=\"4\"><li><span><strong>High-impact uses in safety-critical contexts</strong></span> (clinical decision support, critical-infrastructure operations). <br /><span>Regulatory adherence</span><em><span><em>:</em></span></em><span> rigorous predeployment testing tied to the specific use, continuous monitoring, incident reporting, and, when </span><span>warranted</span><span>, authorization linked to validated performance.</span> </li></ol><ol start=\"5\"><li><span><strong>Hazardous dual-use functions</strong></span> (for example, tools to fabricate biometric voiceprints to defeat authentication). <br /><span>Regulatory adherence</span><em><span><em>:</em></span></em> <span>confine to</span> licensed facilities and verified operators; prohibit capabilities whose primary purpose is unlawful. <br /> <br /><span><h2>Close the loop at real-world choke points</h2></span><span>AI-enabled systems become real when they\u2019re connected to users, money, infrastructure, and institutions, and that\u2019s where regulators should focus enforcement: at the points of distribution (app stores and enterprise marketplaces), capability access (cloud and AI platforms), monetization (payment systems and ad networks), and risk transfer (insurers and contract counterparties).</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>For high-risk uses, we need to require identity binding for operators, capability gating aligned to the risk tier, and tamper-evident logging for audits and postincident review, paired with privacy protections. We need to demand evidence for deployer claims, </span><span>maintain</span> incident-response plans, report material faults, and provide human fallback. When AI use leads to damage, firms should have to show their work and face liability for harms.</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>This approach creates market dynamics that accelerate compliance. If </span></span><span><span>crucial business operations such as </span></span><span><span>procurement, access to cloud </span></span><span>services</span><span><span>, and insurance depend on proving that </span><span>you</span></span><span><span>\u2019re</span> following the rules</span><span><span>, AI model developers will </span><span>build to</span> specifications buyers can check. That raises the safety floor for a</span><span><span>ll industry </span><span>players,</span> startups included, </span><span>without handing an advantage to a few large, licensed incumbents.</span> <br /> <br /><span><h2>The E.U. approach: How this aligns, where it differs</h2></span><span><span>This framework aligns with the E.U. AI Act in two important ways. First, it centers risk at the point of impact: The act\u2019s \u201chigh-risk\u201d categories include employment, education, access to essential services, and critical infrastructure, with life-cycle obligations and complaint rights. It also recognizes special treatment for broadly capable systems (GPAI) without pretending publication control is a safety strategy. My proposal for the United States differs in three </span><span>key ways</span><span>:</span></span> <br /> <br /><span>First, the U.S. must design for constitutional durability. Courts have treated source code as protected speech, and a regime that requires permission to publish weights or train a class of models starts to resemble prior restraint. A use-based regime of rules governing what AI operators can do in sensitive settings, and under what conditions, fits more naturally within the U.S. First Amendment doctrine than speaker-based licensing schemes.</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>Second, </span><span>the</span> E.U. can rely on platforms adapting to the precautionary rules it writes for its unified single market. The U.S. should accept that models will exist globally, both open and closed, and focus on where AI becomes actionable: app stores, enterprise platforms, cloud providers, enterprise identity layers, payment rails, insurers, and regulated-sector gatekeepers (hospitals, utilities, banks). Those are enforceable points where identity, logging, capability gating, and postincident accountability can be </span><span>required</span> without pretending we can \u201ccontain\u201d software. They also span the many specialized U.S. agencies that may not be able to write higher-level rules broad enough to affect the whole AI ecosystem. Instead, the U.S. should regulate AI service choke points more explicitly than Europe does, to accommodate the different shape of its government and public administration. <br /> <br /><span>Third, the U.S. should add an explicit \u201cdual-use hazard\u201d tier. The E.U. AI Act is primarily a fundamental-rights and product-safety regime. The United States also has a national-security reality: Certain capabilities are dangerous because they scale harm (biosecurity, cyberoffense, mass fraud). A coherent U.S. framework should name that category and regulate it directly, rather than trying to fit it into generic \u201cfrontier model\u201d licensing.</span> <br /> <br /><span><h2>China\u2019s approach: What to reuse, what to avoid</h2></span><span><span>China has built a layered regime for public-facing AI. The \u201cdeep synthesis\u201d rules (effective 10 January 2023) require conspicuous labeling of synthetic media and place duties on providers and platforms. The </span></span><span><strong>I</strong></span><span>nterim Measures for Generative AI (effective 15 August 2023) add registration and governance obligations for services offered to the public. Enforcement leverages platform control and algorithm filing systems.</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>The United States should not copy China\u2019s state-directed control of AI viewpoints or information management; it is incompatible with U.S. values and would not survive U.S. constitutional scrutiny. The licensing of model publication is brittle in practice and, in the United States, </span><span>likely an</span> unconstitutional </span><span>form of censorship</span><span>.</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>But we can borrow two practical ideas from China. First, we should ensure trustworthy provenance and traceability for synthetic media. This involves mandatory labeling and </span><span>provenance</span> <span>forensic </span><span>tools. They give legitimate creators and platforms a reliable way to prove origin and integrity. When it is quick to check authenticity at scale, attackers lose the advantage of cheap copies or </span><span>deepfakes</span> and defenders regain time to detect, triage, and respond. Second, we should require </span><span>operators to</span> file their methods <span>and risk controls </span><span>with </span><span>regulators</span> for public-facing, high-risk services, like we do for other <span>safety-critical</span> projects. This should include due-process and transparency safeguards <span>appropriate to</span> liberal democracies along with clear responsibility for safety measures, data protection, and incident handling, especially for systems designed to manipulate emotions or build dependency, which already include gaming, role-playing, and <span>associated applications</span><span>.</span> <br /> <br /><span><h2>A pragmatic approach</h2></span><span><span>We cannot meaningfully regulate the development of AI in a world where artifacts copy in near real time and research flows fluidly across borders. But we can keep unvetted systems out of hospitals, payment systems, and critical infrastructure by regulating uses, not models; </span><span>enforcing at</span> choke points; and applying obligations that scale with risk. </span> <br /> <br /><span><span>Done right, this approach harmonizes with the E.U.\u2019s outcome-oriented framework, channels U.S. federal and state innovation into a coherent baseline, and reuses China\u2019s useful distribution-level controls while rejecting speech-restrictive licensing. We can write rules that protect people </span></span><span>and that still promote robust AI innovation.</span> <br /> </li></ol>", "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-model-regulation", "published_at": "Mon, 02 Fe", "source_type": "rss", "credibility_tier": "A", "theme_tags": ["evaluations", "governance"], "key_claims": [], "why_it_matters": "", "risk_notes": "", "raw_text_snippets": ["<img src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/silhouettes-looking-at-screens-sit-behind-a-building-shape-with-the-scales-of-justice-in-a-digital-grid-patterned-setting.jpg?id=63516186&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=277%2C0%2C278%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p><span><span>At times, it</span"], "scores": {"relevance": 0.4, "novelty": 0.8, "strategic_leverage": 0.625, "credibility": 1.0, "composite": 0.6462}}

On January 6, 2026, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued new guidance documents clarifying how it interprets existing law for the review of wearable and AI-assisted devices. </p><p>The first document, for <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/general-wellness-policy-low-risk-devices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">general wellness</a>, specifies that the FDA will interpret noninvasive sensors such as sleep trackers or heart rate monitors as low-risk wellness devices while treating invasive devices under conventional regulations. The other document defines how the FDA will exempt <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/clinical-decision-support-software\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">clinical decision support tools</a> from medical device regulations, limiting such software to analyzing existing data rather than extracting data from sensors, and requiring them to enable independent review of their recommendations. The documents do not rewrite any statutes, but they refine interpretation of existing law, compared to the 2019 and 2022 documents they replace. They offer a fresh lens on how regulators see technology that sits at the intersection of consumer electronics, software, and medicine\u2014a category many other countries are choosing to regulate more strictly rather than less.</p><h2>What the 2026 update changed</h2><p>The 2026 FDA update clarifies how it distinguishes between \u201cmedical information\u201d and systems that measure physiological \u201csignals\u201d or \u201cpatterns.\u201d Earlier guidance discussed these concepts more generally, but the new version defines signal-measuring systems as those that collect continuous, near-continuous, or streaming data from the body for medical purposes, such as home devices transmitting blood pressure, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/should-you-trust-apples-new-blood-oxygen-sensor\" target=\"_blank\">oxygen saturation</a>, or <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/smartphone-camera-senses-patients-pulse-breathing-rate\" target=\"_blank\">heart rate</a> to clinicians. It gives more concrete examples, like a blood glucose lab result as medical information versus continuous glucose monitor readings as signals or patterns.</p><p>The updated guidance also sharpens examples of what counts as medical information that software may display, analyze, or print. These include radiology reports or summaries from legally marketed software, ECG reports annotated by clinicians, blood pressure results from cleared devices, and lab results stored in electronic health records. </p><p>In addition, the 2026 update softens FDA\u2019s earlier stance on clinical decision tools that offer only one recommendation. While prior guidance suggested tools needed to present multiple options to avoid regulation, FDA now indicates that a single recommendation may be acceptable if only one option is clinically appropriate, though it does not define how that determination will be made. </p><p>Separately, updates to the general wellness guidance clarify that some non-invasive wearables\u2014such as optical sensors estimating blood glucose for wellness or nutrition awareness\u2014may qualify as general wellness products, while more invasive technologies would not.</p><h2>Wellness still requires accuracy</h2><p>For designers of wearable health devices, the practical implications go well beyond what label you choose. \u201cCalling something \u2018wellness\u2019 doesn\u2019t reduce the need for rigorous validation,\u201d says <a href=\"https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/omer-t-inan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Omer Inan</a>, a medical device technology researcher at the Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. A wearable that reports blood pressure inaccurately could lead a user to conclude that their values are normal when they are not\u2014potentially influencing decisions about seeking clinical care.</p><p>\u201cIn my opinion, engineers designing devices to deliver health and wellness information to consumers should not change their approach based on this new guidance,\u201d says Inan. Certain measurements\u2014such as blood pressure or glucose\u2014carry real medical consequences regardless of how they\u2019re branded, Inan notes.</p><p>Unless engineers follow robust validation protocols for technology delivering health and wellness information, Inan says, consumers and clinicians alike face the risk of faulty information.</p><p>To address that, Inan advocates for transparency: companies should publish their validation results in peer-reviewed journals, and independent third parties without financial ties to the manufacturer should evaluate these systems. That approach, he says, helps the engineering community and the broader public assess the accuracy and reliability of wearable devices.</p><h2>When wellness meets medicine</h2><p>The societal and clinical impacts of wearables are already visible, regardless of regulatory labels, says Sharona Hoffman, JD, a law and bioethics professor at Case Western Reserve University.</p><p>Medical metrics from devices like the Apple Watch or Fitbit may be framed as \u201cwellness,\u201d but in practice many users treat them like medical data, influencing their behavior or decisions about care, Hoffman points out.</p><p>\u201cIt could cause anxiety for patients who constantly check their metrics,\u201d she notes. Alternatively, \u201cA person may enter a doctor\u2019s office confident that their wearable has diagnosed their condition, complicating clinical conversations and decision-making.\u201d</p><p>Moreover, privacy issues remain unresolved, unmentioned in previous or updated guidance documents. Many companies that design wellness devices fall outside protections like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), meaning data about health metrics could be collected, shared, or sold without the same constraints as traditional medical data. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what they\u2019re collecting information about or whether marketers will get hold of it,\u201d Hoffman says. </p><h2>International approaches</h2><p>The European Union\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Act designates systems that process health-related data or influence clinical decisions as \u201chigh risk,\u201d subjecting them to stringent requirements around data governance, transparency, and human oversight. China and South Korea have also implemented rules that tighten controls on algorithmic systems that intersect with healthcare or public-facing use cases. South Korea provides very specific categories for regulation for technology makers, such as <a href=\"https://www.mfds.go.kr/eng/brd/m_40/list.do\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">standards on labeling and description on medical devices and good manufacturing practices</a>. </p><p>Across these regions, regulators are not only classifying technology by its intended use but also by its potential impact on individuals and society at large.</p><p>\u201cOther countries that emphasize technology are still worrying about data privacy and patients,\u201d Hoffman says. \u201cWe\u2019re going in the opposite direction.\u201d</p><h2>Post-market oversight </h2><p>\u201cRegardless of whether something is FDA approved, these technologies will need to be monitored in the sites where they\u2019re used,\u201d says Todd R. Johnson, a professor of biomedical informatics at McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics at UTHealth Houston, who has worked on FDA-regulated products and informatics in clinical settings. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the makers can ensure ahead of time that all of the recommendations will be sound.\u201d</p><p>Large health systems may have the capacity to audit and monitor tools, but smaller clinics often do not. Monitoring and auditing are not emphasized in the current guidance, raising questions about how reliability and safety will be maintained once devices and software are deployed widely.</p><h2>Balancing innovation and safety</h2><p>For engineers and developers, the FDA\u2019s 2026 guidance presents both opportunities and responsibilities. By clarifying what counts as a regulated device, the agency may reduce upfront barriers for some categories of technology. But that shift also places greater weight on design rigor, validation transparency, and post-market scrutiny. </p><p>\u201cDevice makers do care about safety,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cBut regulation can increase barriers to entry while also increasing safety and accuracy.

Brian will be sharing his advice on engineering careers with you in the coming weeks of Career Alert.</span></p><p>Here\u2019s a note from Brian: </p><p>\u201c12 years ago, I learned to code at the age of 30. Since then I\u2019ve led engineering teams, worked at organizations ranging from five-person startups to Fortune 500 companies, and taught hundreds of others who want to break into tech. I write for engineers who want practical ways to get better at what they do and advance in their careers. I hope you find what I write helpful.\u201d</p><h1>Technical Interviews in the Age of AI Tools</h1><p>Last year, I was conducting interviews for an AI startup position. We allowed unlimited AI usage during the technical challenge round. Candidates could use Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, or any assistant they normally worked with. We wanted to see how they used modern tools.</p><p>During one interview, we asked a candidate a simple question: \u201cCan you explain what the first line of your solution is doing?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>After a long pause, he admitted he had no idea. His solution was correct. The code worked. But he couldn\u2019t explain how or why. This wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. Around 20 percent of the candidates we interviewed were unable to explain how their solutions worked, only that they did.</p><h2>When AI Makes Interviews Harder</h2><p>A few months earlier, I was on the other side of the table at this same company. During a live interview, I instinctively switched from my AI-enabled code editor to my regular one. The CTO stopped me.</p><p>\u201cJust use whatever you normally would. We want to see how you work with AI.\u201d</p><p>I thought the interview would be easy. But I was wrong.</p><p>Instead of only evaluating correctness, the interviewer focused on my decision-making process:</p><ul><li>Why did I accept certain suggestions?</li><li>Why did I reject others?</li><li>How did I decide when AI helped versus when it created more work?</li></ul><p>I wasn\u2019t just solving a problem in front of strangers. I was explaining my judgment and defending my decisions in real time, and AI created more surface area for judgment. Counterintuitively, the interview was harder.</p><h2>The Shift in Interview Evaluation</h2><p>Most engineers now use AI tools in some form, whether they write code, analyze data, design systems, or automate workflows. AI can generate output quickly, but it can\u2019t explain intent, constraints, or tradeoffs. </p><p>More importantly, it can\u2019t take responsibility when something breaks.</p><p>As a result, major companies and startups alike are now adapting to this reality by shifting to interviews with AI. Meta, Rippling, and Google, for instance, have all begun allowing candidates to use AI assistants in technical sessions. And the goal has evolved: interviewers want to understand how you evaluate, modify, and trust AI-generated answers. </p><p>So, how can you succeed in these interviews?</p><h2>What Actually Matters in AI-Enabled Interviews</h2><p><strong>Refusing to use AI out of principle doesn\u2019t help.</strong> Some candidates avoid AI to prove they can think independently. This can backfire. If the organization uses AI internally\u2014and most do\u2014then refusing to use it signals rigidity, not strength.</p><p><strong>Silence is a red flag.</strong> Interviews aren\u2019t natural working environments. We don\u2019t usually think aloud when deep in a complex problem, but silence can raise concerns. If you\u2019re using AI, explain what you\u2019re doing and why:</p><ul><li>\u201cI\u2019m using AI to sketch an approach, then validating assumptions.\u201d</li><li>\u201cThis suggestion works, but it ignores a constraint we care about.\u201d</li><li>\u201cI\u2019ll accept this part, but I want to simplify it.\u201d</li></ul><p>Your decision-making process is what separates effective engineers from prompt jockeys.</p><p><strong>Treat AI output as a first draft.</strong> Blind acceptance is the fastest way to fail. Strong candidates immediately evaluate the output: Does this meet the requirements? Is it unnecessarily complex? Would I stand behind this in production?</p><p>Small changes like renaming variables, removing abstractions, or tightening logic signal ownership and critical thinking.</p><p><strong>Optimize for trust, not completion.</strong> Most AI tools can complete a coding challenge faster than any human. Interviews that allow AI are testing something different. They\u2019re answering: \u201cWould I trust this person to make good decisions when things get messy?\u201d</p><h2>Adapting to a Shifting Landscape</h2><p>Interviews are changing faster than most candidates realize. Here\u2019s how to prepare:</p><p><strong>Start using AI tools daily.</strong> If you\u2019re not already working with Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, or CoPilot, start now. Build muscle memory for prompting, evaluating output, and catching errors.</p><p><strong>Develop your rejection instincts.</strong> The skill isn\u2019t using AI.

Communities that make collective decisions tend to develop strong institutional identities. And those identities sometimes spawn reflexively conservative impulses.</p><p>Giving users agency over Wikipedia\u2019s rules, as I\u2019ve discovered in some of <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301663933_Wikimedia_movement_governance_the_limits_of_a-hierarchical_organization\" target=\"_blank\">my own studies of Wikipedia</a>, can lead an institution away ultimately from the needs of those the institution serves.</p><p>Wikipedia\u2019s editors have built the largest collaborative knowledge project in human history. But the governance these editors exercise increasingly resists new generations of innovation.</p><p>Paradoxically, Wikipedia\u2019s revolutionarily collaborative structure once put it at the vanguard of innovation on the open internet. But now that same structure may be failing newer generations of readers.</p><h3>Does Wikipedia\u2019s Format Belong to Readers or Editors?</h3><p>There\u2019s a generational disconnect today at the heart of Wikipedia\u2019s current struggles. The encyclopedia\u2019s format remains wedded to the information-dense, text-heavy style of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica\" target=\"_blank\">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>\u2014the very model Wikipedia was designed to replace.</p><p>A Britannica replacement made sense in 2001. One-quarter of a century ago, the average internet user was older and accustomed to reading long-form content.</p><p>However, teens and twentysomethings today are of a very different demographic and have markedly different media consumption habits compared to Wikipedia\u2019s forebears. <a href=\"https://www.gwi.com/blog/gen-z-vs-gen-alpha\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Z and Gen Alpha</a> readers are accustomed to TikTok, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-youtube-era-made-cloud-gaming-possible\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>, and mobile-first visual media. Their impatience for Wikipedia\u2019s impenetrable walls of text, as any parent of kids of this age knows, arguably threatens the future of the internet\u2019s collaborative knowledge clearinghouse.</p><p>The Wikimedia Foundation knows this, too. <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2025/11/10/in-the-ai-era-wikipedia-has-never-been-more-valuable/\" target=\"_blank\">Research has shown</a> that many readers today greatly value quick overviews of any article, before the reader considers whether to dive into the article\u2019s full text. </p><p>So last June, the Foundation launched a modest experiment they called \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_Wikimedia_projects#Beginnings_of_generative_AI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Article Summaries</a>.\u201d The summaries consisted of AI-generated, simplified text at the top of complex articles. Summaries were clearly labeled as machine-generated and unverified, and they were available only to mobile users who opted in.</p><p>Even after all these precautions, however, the volunteer editor community barely gave the experiment time to begin. Editors shut down Simple Article Summaries within <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/wikipedia-pauses-ai-generated-summaries-pilot-after-editors-protest/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a day</a> of its launch.</p><p>The response was fierce. Editors called the experiment a \u201cghastly idea\u201d and warned of \u201cimmediate and irreversible harm\u201d to Wikipedia\u2019s credibility.</p><p>Comments in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)/Archive_221\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">village pump</a> (a community discussion page) ranged from blunt (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-pauses-ai-summaries-after-editor-revolt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yuck\u201d</a>) to alarmed, with contributors raising <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-pauses-ai-generated-summaries-after-editor-backlash/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">legitimate concerns</a> about AI hallucinations and the erosion of editorial oversight.</p><h3>Revisiting Wikipedia\u2019s Past Helps Reveal Its Future</h3><p>Last year\u2019s Simple Summaries storm, and sudden silencing, should be considered in light of historical context. Consider three other flashpoints from Wikipedia\u2019s past:</p><p>In 2013, the Foundation launched VisualEditor\u2014a \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d interface meant to make editing easier\u2014as the default for all newcomers. However, the interface often crashed, broke articles, and was so slow that experienced editors fled. After <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor/RFC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">protests erupted</a>, a Wikipedia administrator <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2013/09/25/wikipedia_peasants_revolt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">overrode</a> the Foundation\u2019s rollout, returning VisualEditor to an opt-in feature.</p><p>The following year brought <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Media_Viewer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Media Viewer</a>, which changed how images were displayed. The community voted to disable it. Then, when an administrator implemented that consensus, a Foundation executive reversed the change and threatened to revoke the admin\u2019s privileges. On the German Wikipedia, the Foundation deployed a new \u201csuperprotect\u201d user right to prevent the community from turning off Media Viewer.</p><p>Even proposals that technically won majority support met resistance. In 2011, the Foundation held a referendum on an image filter that would let readers voluntarily hide graphic content. Despite <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image_filter_referendum/Sue's_report_to_the_board/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">56 percent support</a>, the feature was shelved after the German Wikipedia community voted 86 percent against it.</p><p>These three controversies from Wikipedia\u2019s past reveal how genuine conversations can achieve\u2014after disagreements and controversy\u2014compromise and evolution of Wikipedia\u2019s features and formats. Reflexive vetoes of new experiments, as the Simple Summaries spat highlighted last summer, is not genuine conversation.</p><p>Supplementing Wikipedia\u2019s Encyclopedia Britannica\u2013style format with a small component that contains AI summaries is not a simple problem with a cut-and-dried answer, though neither were VisualEditor or Media Viewer.</p><p>Why did 2025\u2019s Wikipedia crisis result in immediate clampdown, whereas its internal crises from 2011\u20132014 found more community-based debates involving discussions and plebiscites? Is Wikipedia\u2019s global readership today witnessing the first signs of a dangerous generation gap?</p><h3>Wikipedia Needs to Air Its Sustainability Crisis</h3><p>A still deeper crisis haunts the online encyclopedia: the sustainability of unpaid labor. Wikipedia was built by volunteers who found meaning in collective knowledge creation. That model worked brilliantly when a generation of internet enthusiasts had time, energy, and idealism to spare. But the volunteer base is aging. A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_community\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2010 study</a> found the average Wikipedia contributor was in their mid-twenties; today, many of those same editors are now in their forties or fifties.</p><p>Meanwhile, the tech industry has discovered how to extract billions in value from their work. AI companies train their large language models on Wikipedia\u2019s corpus. The <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2025/11/10/in-the-ai-era-wikipedia-has-never-been-more-valuable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Foundation recently noted</a> it remains one of the highest-quality datasets in the world for AI development. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Research confirms</a> that when developers try to omit Wikipedia from training data, their models produce answers that are less accurate, less diverse, and less verifiable.</p><p>The irony is stark. AI systems deliver answers derived from Wikipedia without sending users back to the source. Google\u2019s AI Overviews, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatgpt-checking-sucks\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a>, and countless other tools have learned from Wikipedia\u2019s volunteer-created content\u2014then present that knowledge in ways that break the virtuous cycle Wikipedia depends on. Fewer readers visit the encyclopedia directly. Fewer visitors become editors. Fewer users donate. The pipeline that sustained Wikipedia for a quarter century is breaking down.</p><h3>What Does Wikipedia\u2019s Next 25 Years Look Like?</h3><p>The Simple Summaries situation arguably risks making the encyclopedia increasingly irrelevant to younger generations of readers. And they\u2019ll be relying on Wikipedia\u2019s information commons for the longest time frame of any cohort now editing or reading it.</p><p>On the other hand, a larger mandate does, of course, remain at Wikipedia to serve as stewards of the information commons. And wrongly implementing Simple Summaries could fail this ambitious objective. Which would be terrible, too. </p><p>All of which, frankly, are what open discussions and sometimes-messy referenda are all about: not just sudden shutdowns.</p><p>Meanwhile, AI systems should credit Wikipedia when drawing on its content, maintaining the transparency that builds public trust. Companies profiting from Wikipedia\u2019s corpus should pay for access through legitimate channels like Wikimedia Enterprise, rather than scraping servers or relying on data dumps that strain infrastructure without contributing to maintenance.</p><p>Perhaps as the AI marketplace matures, there could be room for new large language models trained exclusively on trustworthy Wikimedia data\u2014transparent, verifiable, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14292\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">free from the pollution of synthetic AI-generated content</a>. Perhaps, too, Creative Commons licenses need <a href=\"https://www.jipitec.eu/jipitec/article/view/415\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">updating to account for AI-era realities</a>.</p><p>Perhaps Wikipedia itself needs new modalities for creating and sharing knowledge\u2014ones that preserve editorial rigor while meeting audiences where they are.</p><p>Wikipedia has survived edit wars, vandalism campaigns, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_of_the_end_of_Wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">countless predictions of its demise</a>. It has patiently outlived the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/12/giz139/5651107\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">skeptics who dismissed it as unreliable</a>. It has proven that strangers can collaborate to build something remarkable.</p><p>But Wikipedia cannot survive by refusing to change. Ostrom\u2019s Nobel Prize\u2013winning research reminds us that the communities that govern shared resources often grow conservative over time.</p><p>For anyone who cares about the future of reliable information online, Wikipedia\u2019s 25th anniversary is not just a celebration. It is an urgent warning about what happens when the institutions we depend on cannot adapt to the people they are meant to serve.</p><p><em>Dariusz Jemielniak is vice president of the </em><em><a href=\"https://pan.pl/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Polish Academy of Sciences</a></em><em>, a full professor at </em><em><a href=\"https://www.kozminski.edu.pl/en\" target=\"_blank\">Kozminski University</a></em><em> in Warsaw, and a faculty associate at the </em><em><a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society</a></em><em> at Harvard University.
