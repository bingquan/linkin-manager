Most people will cite NIST AI Risk Management Framework for results. The real lesson is in the eval assumptions.

NIST AI Risk Management Framework is worth attention, but only if we separate signal from framing.
Core claim: The public narrative overstates capability when evaluation scope is narrow.

Most discussion focuses on first-order performance metrics.
The practical question is what fails when assumptions shift: data regime, user behavior, and adversarial pressure.

Technical anchor: threat model assumptions define whether the reported mitigation is meaningful.

Systems implication: organizations that separate model quality from governance quality will misprice operational risk, especially when incentives reward launch speed over eval depth.

Judgment: this is useful progress, but teams should delay broad rollout until they can reproduce results under their own threat model and monitoring constraints.

Prompt question: What evidence would change your deployment decision this quarter?
